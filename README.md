This is the repository for our paper "Can LLMs Threaten Human Survival? Benchmarking Potential Existential Threats from LLMs via Prefix Completion".

Our dataset can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LMPC-Lab/ExistBench


## The essence of our work rests on two key points:

### 1. AGI has the potential to pose a threat to human survival;

### 2. The prefix completion mode of LLM reasoning should be given consideration in benchmark research.
